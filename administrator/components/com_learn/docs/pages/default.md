Welcome to Nooku 101
====================

Now that you've installed Nooku Server, you'll have no problem trying out the **Nooku Framework**.

This Tutorial was created to guide you through the basics of Nooku. It touches on some advanced topics, but that's a little bit in the future.

In this Tutorial, each page is carefully written to not overwhelm you with information. A very small topic is covered as much as possible.
